# Web Content Bank
A content bank for startups (transactionnal, sales, communication, ...).

## Folder Organization
Content is organized as follows :
- area
  - category
    -   type
      -   (variations)
        -   lang

## Variables
Along the content, we use double curled expressions that should be replaced by your custom variable. Ex : {{company_name}} should be replaced by _Elokenz_ if it's your company name. A list of all variables with their definition is accessible in the __references__ folder.
