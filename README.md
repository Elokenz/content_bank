# Web Content Bank
A content bank for startups (transactionnal, sales, communication, ...).
Content is organized as follows :

- category
  -   type
    -   (variations)
      -   lang

Along the content, we use double curled expressions that should be replaced by your custom variable. Ex : {{company_name}} should be replaced by _Elokenz_ if it's your company name. A list of all variables with their definition is accessible in the __references__ forlder.

## Categories
Here are the categories :
- Transactionnal
- Sales
- Funding
- Influencer Marketing
- PR

## Types

### Transactional
- Welcome
- Email Lost
- Password Changed

### Sales
- Get in touch
- Follow-up


## Announcements
We are looking for the best way to offer the translations. Should they be in .po format ? If you have an idea, please discuss that in the [issue thread](https://github.com/Elokenz/content_bank/issues/1).
